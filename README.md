### UNIVERSITY PROJECT

Alexa Skills are apps for Alexa. Alexa Skills give the users a hands-free way to interact with the skill. However, the user is limited only to the skills available. If the user wants a new skill for their needs, the user should program a skill using Alexa Developer Console and Lambda functions. The goal of the project was to develop a skill that would allow the users to develop other skill only using voice interface which would not require any coding excperience at all.
